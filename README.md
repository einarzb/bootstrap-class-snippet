# bootstrap-class-snippet

Ever got tired of writing bootstrap hierarchy classes over and over again?

I did. 

So I wrote a *snippet*  for SUBLIME (sorry atom)  which creates the basic layout of bootstrap classes.

follow the simple instructions in the xml and whenever you type: boot + keyboard TAB, youll get this baby:

<pre><div class="container"> *change to fluid if needed*
      <div class="row">
            <div class="col"> *you need to add the size and number by yourself! *
              
            </div>
      </div>        
  </div>
  </pre>
